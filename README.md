Data Analysis of the Health Insurance Marketplace Public Use Files:

https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data-resources/marketplace-puf.html

The files contain information on health insurance plans for 2014, 2015 and 2016 that were offered through www.healthcare.gov. The data is made available through the US Department of Health and Human Services on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hhsgov.

This project contains a Jupyter notebook with a Python/Pandas analysis of the files Rate.csv and PlanAttributes.csv that can be downloaded from the kaggle website. The files contain the raw data combined for 2014, 2015 and 2016. 

The script performs a thorough cleaning of the dataset, extraction of monthly premiums for individuals, and comparison of average rates across the US.
